**Note:** 

This is only the UI framework project, in order to run the website locally you also need to run the [website project](https://github.com/adampoczatek/adampoczatek.github.io).

To run the UI project for the first time you need to clone the repository and run:

```
npm install
```

To run the UI server you need to execute:

```
npm start
```

Also, you can start [Fractal pattern library](https://fractal.build/) with:

```
npm run dev:library
```

> **Note:** in order to run the pattern library you also need to have the UI server running.
